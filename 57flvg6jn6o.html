<div>The central complex consists of three main neuropiles -- the protocerebral bridge (PB), the ellipsoid body (EB, central body lower in non drosophila species) and the fan-shaped body (FB, central body upper in non-drosophila species) -- and at least three accessory neuropiles -- the noduli (NO), the gall (GA), the lateral accessory lobe (LAL)  (<b>references and figure</b>). The most striking neural elements of the central complex are the&nbsp;<i>columnar neurons</i> : those innervate one of the sixteen glomeruli of the PB, one columnar section of either the PB or EB, and one accessory neuropile. The column correspondances between the PB and EB/FB are stereotypical, and a total of XX different such types have been described. To those "principal cells" one need to add a number of neurons innervating accross several columns, often inside subdivisions orthogonal to the columns, sometimes in addition to neuropiles outside . These includes the ring neurons, which innervate the circumference of the EB and the bulb (BU), FB and PB interneurons and potential input elements (<b>do we want to develop this ?</b>). From this light level anatomy and putative synaptic polarity, one can derive an hypothetical general information flow diagram of the central complex (figure <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{288889}</span>) :</div><ul><li>ring neurons feed inputs into the EB columnar neurons.&nbsp;</li><li>Recurrent connections between EB columnar neurons are present, and thought to sustain the formation of the ring attractor</li><li>Information is transferred from the EB columnar system to the FB columnar system via the PB (interestingly, only one columnar neuron displays presynaptic terminals in the PB, an EB-PB-Gall neuron)</li><li>FB columnar neurons also receive inputs in the FB</li><li>All columnar neurons also receive inputs in the PB</li><li>Interneurons in the PB and FB further interconnect the columns</li><li>All accessory structures are potential outputs&nbsp;</li></ul><div>We show that this overall flow of information is generally supported functionally for the parts we have tested so far, with a few twists : connectivity in the PB is very sparse, accessory structures are usually input areas, and consequently output channels of the CX are scarce.

The overlap was looked at on digitally aligned images of individual driver lines (<b>a ref for the flylight alignment ?</b>). For each considered pair, one or several genotypes were prepared to express Cs-Chrimson and GCaMP6-m in the potential pre and post-synaptic partners, respectively (see Material and methods). Brains and VNCs were dissected out the flies heads and tested with a standardized protocol (see fig). The light stimulation intensities/pattern were kept at low levels (50uW/mm<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>given in trains of 2ms pulses) to reduce the chances of observing indirect connections, while at the same time still allowing us to see near saturating responses in strongly connected pairs (see ??). When responses were sizable, pharmacology was used to insure that the observed transients were synaptically mediated and narrow down the nature&nbsp;</div>
