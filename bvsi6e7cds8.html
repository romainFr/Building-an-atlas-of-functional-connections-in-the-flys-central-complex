<div>In addition to 41 potential pairs, the screen also included 23 pairs of neighboring but non-overlapping neurons to control for the specificity of the responses observed, and 6 direct-activation controls in which CsChrimson and GCaMP6-m were expressed in the same neurons.</div><h2 data-label="148874" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="148874" class="ltx_title_subsection"> Characterization of responses</h2><div>The range of observed responses is summarized in figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>A. Effects of stimulation ranged from a total absence of change (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Aiii) to very large and reliable transients (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Ai). In between those extremes, we  observed transients of variable size and reliability  (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>B). Interestingly, we  also detected inhibitory responses. This was rendered possible by the fact that — at least in some cell types — the baseline fluorescence was fluctuating during the experiment (see Discussion and Supplementary Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{998826}</span>) even if hyperpolarization below the resting potential is likely not detectable through GCaMP6m imaging, inhibition from an excited state  appears as dips in the fluorescence trace (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Aii).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
