<div>Besides <b>XX</b> potential pairs, the screen also included&nbsp;<b>XX</b> pairs of neighboring but non-overlapping neurons to control for the specificity of the responses observed, and&nbsp;<b>XX</b>&nbsp; direct activation controls in which CsChrimson and GCaMP6-m where expressed in the same neurons.</div><h2 data-label="148874" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="148874" class="ltx_title_subsection">Response characterization</h2><div>The range of observed responses is exposed in figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>A. Upon stimulation, effects ranged from a total absence of change (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Aiii) to very large reliable transients (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Ai). In between those extremes, transients of variable size and reliability could be observed (figure <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>B). Interestingly, we could also observe inhibitory responses. This was rendered possible by the fact that -- at least in some cell types -- the baseline fluorescence was fluctuating during the experiment (see Discussion and figure&nbsp;<b>SXX</b>) : even if hyperpolarizations below the resting potential are likely not detectable through GCaMP imaging, inhibition from an excited state do appear as dips in the fluorescence trace (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Aii).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
