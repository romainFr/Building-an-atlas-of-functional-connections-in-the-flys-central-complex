<div></div><h2 data-label="148874" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div> Effects of stimulation ranged from very large and reliable transients (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Ai) to undetectable changes (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Aiii). In between those extremes, we  observed transients of variable size and reliability  (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>B). Since no single characteristic of the responses could adequately capture their variety, variability and complexity,&nbsp; we chose to characterize the transients by using a battery of statistics reflecting response amplitude, shape, reliability and stimulus sensitivity&nbsp;(see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>C, Supplementary Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{695432}</span>, and Materials and Methods). Responses of control pairs with non-overlapping processes were then used to form the null-hypothesis distributions of two metrics that capture response amplitude and reliability (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>D). For every data point, the Mahalanobis distance (see Method) to  the null distribution was computed. Pairs were considered as connected if this distance fell significantly outside of the distance distribution  of the null sample  (for details see Materials and Methods).</div>
