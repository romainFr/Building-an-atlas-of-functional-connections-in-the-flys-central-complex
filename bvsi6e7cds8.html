<div></div><h2 data-label="148874" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div> Effects of stimulation ranged from very large and reliable transients (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Ai) to a total absence of change (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Aiii). In between those extremes, we  observed transients of variable size and reliability  (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>B). Interestingly, we  also detected inhibitory responses (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Aii). This was  possible because — at least in some cell types —  baseline fluorescence fluctuated and was occasionally elevated during the experiment (see Discussion and Supplementary Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{998826}</span>). Therefore, even if hyperpolarization below the resting potential is likely not detectable through GCaMP6m imaging, inhibition from an excited state  appears as a dip in the fluorescence trace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
