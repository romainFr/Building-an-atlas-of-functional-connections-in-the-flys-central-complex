Upon stimulation, effects ranged from a total absence of change (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Bvi) to very large reliable transients (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Bi). In between those extremes, transients of variable size and reliability could be observed.</div><div>Interestingly, we could also observe inhibitory responses. This was rendered possible by the fact that -- at least in some cell types -- the baseline fluorescence was fluctuating during the experiment (<b>Quantify the spread of baselines for each cell type</b> and the population if it makes sense) : even if hyperpolarizations below the resting potential are likely not detectable through GCaMP imaging (), inhibition from an excited state do appear as dips in the fluorescence trace (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Bii).&nbsp;</div><div>Intriguingly we noticed that even for excitatory responses, the amplitude of the transient seemed to be dependent on the baseline level at the time of stimulation (figure SXX).</div><div>It is worth elaborating on the limitations of the method to insure a correct interpretation of the data presented <b>(to reshape into a paragraph)</b>:</div><ul><li>The combination of CsChrimson and GCaMP does not strictly insure that the responses observe are direct. We did choose to use low stimulation intensities to limit indirect effects (see figure SXX), and the sparseness of the connectivity matrix obtained suggests that this is a reasonable assumption. We tended to interpret small, unreliable responses to be the result of indirect effects.&nbsp;</li><li>The sensitivity of the method is bounded by the stimulation protocol and the sensitivity of GCaMP6-m. This means that an absence of response cannot be formally be interpreted as an absence of connection. Given the range of responses observed, the most difficult pairs to interpret are the ones generating small or unreliable responses upon stimulation.</li><li>The full-field stimulation protocol used here can potentially lead to network artifacts. This is another reason for us to have used low intensity stimulations. Stimulating the full presynaptic population could lead to the recruitment of large inhibitory feedbacks, or other network modules. When we suspected this could be a possibility, we tried to control for it using pharmacology (<b>see Discussion</b>).</li><li>In the ex vivo preparation used, the network state is not controlled. It is possible that some connections are functionally conditional on the overall state of the network (<b>ref Allan/Reiser</b>). The fact that we observe large baseline fluctuations however would tend to indicate that &nbsp;</li></ul><div></div>
