<div></div><h2 data-label="148874" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div> Effects of stimulation ranged from very large and reliable transients (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Ai) to undetectable changes (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Aiii). In between those extremes, we  observed transients of variable size and reliability  (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>B). Interestingly, we could also detect clear inhibitory responses (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Aii), which we did not expect to happen regularl with GCaMP, but. It was possible because —at least in some cell types— fluctuations in baseline activity occasionally elevated GCaMP levels during the experiment (see Discussion and Supplementary Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{998826}</span>). Therefore, even though hyperpolarization below resting potential is likely not detectable through calcium imaging, we could detect inhibition from an excited state as a dip in the fluorescence trace.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Since no single characteristic of the responses could adequately capture their variety, variability and complexity,&nbsp; we chose to characterize the transients by using a battery of statistics reflecting response amplitude, shape, reliability and stimulus sensitivity&nbsp;(see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>C, Supplementary Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{695432}</span>, and Materials and Methods). Responses of control pairs with non-overlapping processes were then used to form the null-hypothesis distributions of two metrics that capture response amplitude and reliability (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>D). For every data point, the Mahalanobis distance (see Methods) to  the null distribution was computed and used as a connection strength metric in synthetic diagrams like Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{384795}</span> and&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>. Non-overlapping pairs usually showed no fluctuations upon stimulation, and when they did, they were small and unreliable (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Di), likely reflecting indirect effects. Not surprisingly, responses were always detected with same-cell-type-stimulation controls&nbsp; (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Dii).&nbsp;</div>
