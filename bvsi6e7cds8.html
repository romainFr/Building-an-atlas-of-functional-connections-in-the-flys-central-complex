This was rendered possible by the fact that -- at least in some cell types -- the baseline fluorescence was fluctuating during the experiment (<b>Quantify the spread of baselines for each cell type</b> and the population if it makes sense) : even if hyperpolarizations below the resting potential are likely not detectable through GCaMP imaging (), inhibition from an excited state do appear as dips in the fluorescence trace (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Bii).&nbsp;</div><div>Limitations of the method : no insurance of directedness (but see figure SXX), sensitivity, imaging/stimulating the full population can potent</div>
