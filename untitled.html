Most of the times both the brain and the ventral nerve chord (VNC) were dissected out, as we found that having the VNC still attached to the brain provided better mechanical stability to the preparation. The dissection was realized using the minimum level of illumination possible to avoid spurious activation of CsChrimson, in the same saline subsequently used for the experiment. Brains were positioned anterior part up, except when the connection tested was thought to be in the protocerebral bridge, where they were turned posterior side up to maximize light access close to the supposed synaptic site. Tracheas were removed, and when a pharmacological application was planned, the glial sheath was gently torn with tweezers to enhance drug access to the neuropiles.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Imaging conditions and trial structure</h2><div>Imaging was done on a 2-photon scanning microscope (PrairieTechnologies, Bruker). Once the sample was placed and centered under the objective, we waited 5 minutes before starting the experiment to avoid any lingering network activation from the dissection or transmission lights. 2-photon excitation wavelength from a Coherent Ultra II (<b>check that</b>) was 920nm, and powers at the sample varied between 3 and 10mW. CsChrimson was excited with trains of 2 ms 590 nm light pulses via a LED (<b>thorlab ref</b>) shining through the objective. The excitation light path contained (<b>filter ref</b>) and (<b>dichroic ref</b>). Instantaneous power measured out of the objective was roughly 50μW/mm 2 . Trains were delivered at 30Hz and the number of pulses was varied between 1,5,10, 20 and 30 -- corresponding to 2ms to 1s long stimulations. Imaging fields of view were chosen as to avoid scanning regions containing the CsChrimson pattern while being as close as possible to the supposed connection site (<b>make a figure to explain that ?</b>) -- and were maintained constant throughout the experiment. Each experimental run consisted of 4 repeats each approximately 16 seconds long. Runs were themselves repeated every 2 minutes. All experiments started with 5 runs corresponding to the 5 stimulation strengths, in a random order. This was sometimes followed by pharmacological testing. At the end of the experiment, a high intensity stack was acquired to insure the expression patterns were as expected, and the region imaged correct. At least 6 flies were tested for every pair considered.</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Pharmacology</h2><div>For blocking nicotinergic or inhibitory (GABAergic or glutamatergic) transmission, mecamylamine (50μM) or picrotoxin (10μM) (<b>refs for drugs</b>) were administered through the perfusion by switching to a different line for 3 minutes, followed by a wash period during which the perfusion was drug-free again. 30 pulses stimulations runs were repeated every 2 minutes starting 4 minutes the drug application and throughout the wash.</div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div>Analysis</div><div>All analysis was performed in&nbsp;<a href="http://julialang.org/" target="_blank">Julia</a>, using custom written routines (<b>we might want to think of making the github of that code public once it's cleaned, then link it on the website/ check if jupyter/figures embedding data would work for elife submissions</b>).</div><div>For a given experiment, all movies were aligned to each other to compensate for slow drifts of the sample : for each run, the average image was calculated, and average images were aligned using correlation based sub-pixel registration (<b>citation to Guizar, link to Julia repo</b>). A region of interest (ROI) was defined for the full experiment : the average image (of all the runs) was clustered between foreground and background by k-means. It’s worth noting that the selection method relies only on average intensity and not activity. This is because we want to use the same detection method for responsive and non-responsive runs. This also relies on selecting fields of view as unambiguously containing the neuron of interest – and only the neuron of interest – during the experiment.</div><div>ΔF/F0 (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\frac{\left(F-F_{0\ }\right)}{\left(F_0-B\right)}\)</span>, where F is the raw fluorescence and B the background f) were then computed for each movie in the ROI. As we noticed that baseline fluorescence could vary widely over the course of an experiment (<b>ref to the part of the results or discussion where we'll cover that</b>), F0 is here defined as the average fluorescence in the 10% (<b>check that</b>) dimmest frames of the full experiment.</div>
