Such a “connectome”, within the framework described by Marr, which distinguishes computations, algorithms and implementations as the three necessary levels of description, allow us to bridge the implementation and the algorithmic level. It is thought of as the structural basis onto which computations occur. Modern neuroscience has concerned itself with the elucidation of the connectome since its inception with the work of Cajal. A variety of approaches have been used. Some methods rely on morphology : sparse labeling (Golgi staining, multicolor flip-outs) and&nbsp; tractographic techniques infer the plausible connections based on anatomy at the neuron or brain region scale. Axonal tracing, and more recently serial reconstruction of large electron microscopy volumes, unambiguously identify cells synaptically connected to each other. A different set of methods rely on neural activity : paired recordings can identify and characterize in great detail the nature of the connection between two given neurons, while multi-unit recordings, EEG or fMRI have been used to measure the extend to which neurons and/or brain regions activity correlate. Such correlative descriptions are usually termed  "functional connectivity" by opposition with "effective connectivity", in the sense that it's not a causal account of the relationships between neuron. In the rest of the manuscript, we will however use the words "functional connectivity" to mean "effective functional connectivity".</div><div>Traditionally, morphological methods tend to produce a more complete image of the connectivity in the sense that they cover a larger proportion of the neurons or areas under study, but they are lacking the functional richness present in activity based methods : the strength and sign of the connections are not directly inferable from those results. On the other side, functional methods are either sparse (in the case of paired recordings) or&nbsp;failing to provide a causal description of the connectivity. Taking advantage of the toolkit available in drosophila melanogaster, we propose an intermediate approach allowing us to map effective functional connectivity at cell resolution with the means of attaining completeness.  We applied this method to the central complex of the fly :&nbsp; by using a combination of optogenetics and calcium imaging (as seen in <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp{hampel_neural_2015,zhou_central_2015,ohyama_multilevel_2015}</cite>), and systematically repeating the experiment with genetically defined pairs of neurons, we built a map of functional connections in the structure.</div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">The central complex is the right amount of "complex"  for the task</h2><div>Positioned deep into the fly's brain, the central complex is a good test bench for circuit cracking : the arrangement of its neurons is striking&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{wolff_neuroarchitecture_2015}</cite>, and physiological experiments have revealed it contains an abstract representation of the animal's heading&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{heinze_maplike_2007,seelig_neural_2015}</cite>. Moreover its modest size (a few thousand neurons, a few dozens of cell types) and genetic accessibility render understanding the computations it performs potentially tractable. For all those reasons, the central complex already inspired a number of theoretical studies&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{kakaria_ring_2017,chang_topographical_2017,givon_generating_2016}</cite>. Most of those are assuming connectivity based on light microscopy level anatomy, therefore relying on Peter's rule (the hypothesis that the strength of the connection between two neurons scales with the overlap between their processes). This is only natural given the wealth of light microscopy anatomy data available. Our functional approach predictably reveals the limits of the assumptions previously made</div><h2 data-label="421494" class="ltx_title_subsection">Making functional connectomics data easily accessible</h2><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">A functional connectivity screen</h2><div></div>
