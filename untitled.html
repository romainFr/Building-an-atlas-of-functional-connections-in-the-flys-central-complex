<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Abstract</h1><div>The  central complex is a highly conserved insect brain region composed of morphologically stereotyped neurons that arborize in distinctively shaped substructures. The region is important for a wide range of behaviors, including  navigation, motor control and sleep, and has been the subject of several modeling studies exploring the circuit mechanisms underlying some of these broadly relevant functions. Most of these modeling studies have relied on assumptions about connectivity between neurons in the region based purely on light-level overlap. Here, we present an extensive functional connectome of&nbsp;<i>drosophila melanogaster</i>'s central complex at cellular resolution. Using optogenetic stimulation and GCaMP recordings as a compromise between throughput and reliability, we tested the connectivity between over 70 potential presynaptic to postsynaptic cell type pairs. Control experiments indicate that the stimulation regimes used were largely selective for monosynaptic connections. Connected pairs were further characterized via pharmacological blocks. The results reveal a range of inputs, some of which had not been previously described, and suggest that the central complex has a fairly limited number of output channels. Moreover, despite the overall high degree of recurrence in the circuit, it appears that some critical parts of the network are much sparser than anticipated, therefore uncovering the potentially critical role of a bottleneck interneuron. All the data is&nbsp; being made available and easily explorable in a website that&nbsp;has the potential to be used to be extended into a general resource about the fly's central complex network as more information becomes available.</div><h1 class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Positioned in the middle of the insect brain, the central complex provides a unique opportunity to obtain mechanistic insights into the way brains build and use abstract representations. Some neurons of the central complex comprise a compass, tracking the animal's heading. Studies in a variety of insects, including locusts, dung beetles and monarch butterflies, have used intracellular recordings to chart maps of polarized light E-vectors in substructures of the region&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Heinze_2007a,26305929}</cite>, and extracellular recordings from the  cockroach  have found sensory and motor correlates throughout the region&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Bender_2010,Guo_2012,Roy_2012}</cite>. More recently, experiments in behaving&nbsp;<i>Drosophila</i> have shown that both visual and motor cues can update the fly's internal compass&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Seelig_2015}</cite>. Independently, neurogenetic studies have used disruptions of the normal physiology of the structure to highlight its involvement in a variety of functions, including motor coordination&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Poeck_2008}</cite>, visual memory&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{16452971}</cite>, sensory-motor adaptation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Triphan_2010}</cite>, and short- and long-term spatial memory&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Neuser_2008,Ofstad_2011}</cite>. It is likely that all those tasks rely on the correct establishment and/or use of an internal representation of heading. Moreover, the scale of the network —a few thousands neurons in the fly— and the ease of genetic  access to individual cell types in&nbsp;<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, renders this circuit tractable within current theoretical and experimental frameworks. Detailed light level anatomy&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Hanesch_1989,Lin_2013,Wolff_2015}</cite> of a significant fraction of the cell types is available, together with the means of genetically targeting those types&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Wolff_2015}</cite>. This has given rise to the first mechanistic forays into the way the circuit constructs a stable heading representation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kim_2017}</cite>, and how this representation shifts with together with the orientation of the animal&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Turner_Evans_2017,Green_2017}</cite>. Such results have also inspired a number of modeling attempts at predicting or reproducing  physiological response patterns&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{kakaria_ring_2017,givon_generating_2017,chang_topographical_2017,Turner_Evans_2017,Cope_2017,Su_2017,Fiore_2017}</cite>. Many of these models make assumptions about  connectivity within the central complex based on the degree of overlap at the light microscopy level between  processes that look  bouton-like and those that seem spiny, &nbsp;indicating potential pre- and post-synaptic specializations respectively. We aimed to construct a  connectivity map based on functional data, which includes information about whether connections are effectively excitatory or inhibitory. This map should allow large-scale models to be better constrained,  permit the formulation and testing of new hypotheses, and ultimately help dissect the function of the central complex. Given the likely number of existing and undiscovered cell types in the central complex, &nbsp;the diversity of neurotransmitters and receptors they express, the mixture of pre- and post-synaptic specializations in their arbors, and the dense recurrence of the network, we see this map as an initial framework into which new information can  be incorporated as it becomes available.</div><div>The urge to obtain circuit diagrams is as old as modern neuroscience itself. Cajal and Golgi used sparse labeling techniques to reveal circuit architectures. Methods based on marking a discrete subset of neurons and imaging them with light microscopy has recently been revived in the form of stochastic genetic labeling techniques&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Livet_2007,Hampel_2011,Nern_2015,Lee_2001,Chiang_2011}</cite>&nbsp;and photoactivatable fluorophores&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Patterson_2002,Ruta_2010}</cite>. These methods allow the extraction of the detailed anatomy of individual neurons. But even when used in combination with synaptic markers&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Nicolai_2010,8229205,Zhang_2002,Fouquet_2009}</cite>, such methods do not offer definitive evidence of synaptic connections, as they rely solely on the proximity of putative pre- and post-synaptic compartments. Recently, promising trans-synaptic genetic tagging systems&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Talay_2017,Huang_2017}</cite> have been developed to address some of those issues. Finally, all those approaches do not provide any insight into the functional properties of potential connections. Despite such shortcomings, light-level imaging constitutes a good starting point by constraining the search for possible connections within large  populations of neurons —at the simplest level, if putative pre- and post-synaptic compartments do not overlap in light microscopy images, they cannot be in synaptic contact.</div><div>More recently,  electron microscopy (EM) reconstruction has become the gold standard for connectomics&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Briggman_2012}</cite>. Ideally, it permits the unambiguous identification of synapses between all neurons in a given volume. As game-changing as this capability is, the technique also suffers from a few limitations. Acquiring, processing and analyzing the data is still painstakingly slow. As a result, connectomes from EM data are typically based on data from only one animal. In addition, EM does not permit the identification of neurotransmitter types at a given synapse, nor does it detect gap-junctions in invertebrate tissue, at least at present (<b>Need a reference her</b>e). Finally, it can be challenging to assess the strengths of connections between two neurons, because it is not yet clear whether and how much the number of synapses between them predicts the functional strength of the connection.</div><div>Functional methods address some of those drawbacks. Simple measures of activity have been used to assess a form of functional connectivity : regions or neurons whose simultaneously recorded activity is correlated —either spontaneously or during a given task— are deemed connected. This has been used with EEG, fMRI and MEG recordings in humans to establish maps at the brain region level&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Salvador_2004,Stam_2004}</cite>(<b>review ref ?</b>) and with multi-electrode recordings in monkeys and rodents (for example&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{Gerhard_2011}</cite>). &nbsp;Functional connectivity has also been inferred from correlations or graded changes in the response properties of neurons  recorded in different animals, usually in cases where the neurons have overlapping arbors when examined with light microscopy. This approach has been employed to suggest polarized light processing pathways in the  central complex of the locust and monarch butterfly&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Heinze_2009a,Heinze_2014}</cite>. However, all these methods are correlative and do not provide a causal basis for the inferred connectivity.</div><div>To obtain a causal description of functional connectivity —sometimes termed effective connectivity—  one needs to either stimulate one node of the network while recording from another one, or record both at sufficiently high resolution as to detect hallmarks of direct connectivity. The most reliable application of such an idea is  paired patch-clamp recording. It identifies connected pairs and their functional properties with a high level of detail, but suffers from low throughput. The recent development of optogenetics has expanded the toolkit for simultaneous stimulation and recording experiments, obviating the need for an electrode to stimulate a candidate presynaptic neuron&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{17435752}</cite>. In Drosophila, the ease of use of genetic reagents renders such approaches particularly attractive. Combinations of P2X2 and GCaMP&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{yao_analysis_2012}</cite>, P2X2 and patch-clamp recordings&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hu_functional_2010}</cite>, Channelrhodopsin-2 and patch-clamp&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{gruntman_integration_2013}</cite>, CsChrimson and GCaMP (<cite><a href="#hampel_neural_2015">Hampel et al., 2015;</a>&nbsp;<a href="#zhou_central_2015">Zhou et al., 2015;</a>&nbsp;<a href="#ohyama_multilevel_2015">Ohyama et al., 2015</a></cite>) have been used in individual studies to highlight a small number of connections.&nbsp;Methods that rely on the genetic expression of calcium indicators to detect potential post-synaptic responses operate at a lower resolution than paired-recordings, in the sense that they usually establish connectivity between cell types, as defined by the genetic driver lines used, rather than between individual neurons. They are also ambiguous as far the the directness of the connections are concerned (see results/discussion) and are limited by the sensitivity of the sensors used. Despite these shortcomings, they constitute a good compromise as they still provide causal, as well as functional, connectivity information, and thus at a much higher throughput than double patch recordings. It is also worth noting that the advantages and limitations of those techniques complement almost perfectly those of serial EM reconstructions. We  chose to bring one of those techniques at scale by systematically repeating the experiment with genetically defined pairs of central complex cell types, therefore building a near-complete map of functional connections in the structure at cell-type resolution.</div><h2 data-label="946238" class="ltx_title_subsection">Cell types and information flow in the central complex</h2>
