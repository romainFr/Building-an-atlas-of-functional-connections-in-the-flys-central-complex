<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Abstract</h1><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>It is generally accepted that a full understanding of neural circuits requires a complete description of the connections between neurons. Such a “connectome”, within the framework described by Marr, which distinguishes computations, algorithms and implementations as the three necessary levels of description, allow us to bridge the implementation and the algorithmic level. It is thought of as the structural basis onto which computations occur. Modern neuroscience has concerned itself with the elucidation of the connectome since its inception with the work of Cajal. A variety of approaches have been used. Some methods rely on morphology : sparse labeling (Golgi staining, multicolor flip-outs) and&nbsp; tractographic techniques infer the plausible con tractographyaxonal tracing, , and more recently serial reconstruction of large electron microscopy volumes. Others rely on neural activity : paired recordings, multi-unit recordings, EEG or fMRI.</div><div>Traditionally, morphological methods tend to produce a more complete image of the connectivity in the sense that they cover a larger proportion of the neurons or areas under study, but they are lacking the functional richness present in activity based methods. On the other side, functional methods are either sparse (for example in the case of paired recordings), failing to provide a causal description of the connectivity or lacking spatial resolution.</div><div>Taking advantage of the toolkit available in drosophila melanogaster, we propose an intermediate approach allowing us to map effective functional connectivity at cell resolution with the means of attaining completeness. We applied this method to the central complex of the fly and provide access to the dataset by way of a dedicated visualization website.</div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">The central complex is the right amount of "complex"  for the task</h2><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">A functional connectivity screen</h2><div></div>
