Most of the times both the brain and the ventral nerve chord (VNC) were dissected out, as we found that having the VNC still attached to the brain provided better mechanical stability to the preparation. The dissection was realized using the minimum level of illumination possible to avoid spurious activation of CsChrimson, in the same saline subsequently used for the experiment. Brains were positioned anterior part up, except when the connection tested was thought to be in the protocerebral bridge, where they were turned posterior side up to maximize light access close to the supposed synaptic site. Tracheas were removed, and when a pharmacological application was planned, the glial sheath was gently torn to enhance drug access to the neuropiles.</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Imaging conditions and trials structure</h2><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Analysis</h2><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">A useful ressource for a growing community</h2><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Inputs to the central complex</h2><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Sparse connectivity and bottlenecks</h2><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Scarcity of output channels</h2><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Discussion</h1><div></div>
