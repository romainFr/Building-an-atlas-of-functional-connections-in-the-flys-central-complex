<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Abstract</h1><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Positioned in the middle of the insect brain, the central complex provides a unique opportunity to get mechanistic insights into the way brains build and use abstract representations. Some neurons of the central complex function like a compass, tracking the animal's heading. Studies in a variety of insects, including locusts, dung beetles and monarch butterflies, have used intracellular recordings to chart maps of polarized light E-vectors in substructures of the region&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Heinze_2007a,26305929}</cite>, and extracellular recordings from the  cockroach  have found motor correlates throughout the region. More recently, experiments in behaving <i>Drosophila</i> have shown that both visual and motor cues can update &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Seelig_2015}</cite>. Independently, neurogenetic studies disrupting the normal physiology of the structure have pointed to a variety of roles for the structure, including motor coordination&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Poeck_2008}</cite>, sensory-motor adaptations&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Triphan_2010}</cite>, or spatial memory&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Neuser_2008,Ofstad_2011}</cite>. It is likely that all those tasks rely on the correct establishment and/or use of the orientation map. Moreover, the scale of the network -- a few thousands neurons in the fly -- and the ease of genetic access to individual cell types in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, renders this circuit tractable within current theoretical and experimental frameworks. Detailed light level anatomy&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Hanesch_1989,Lin_2013,Wolff_2015}</cite> of a significant fraction of the cell types is available, together with the means of genetically targeting those types. This has given rise to the first mechanistic forays into the way the circuit constructs a stable orientation representation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kim_2017}</cite>, and how this representation shifts with together with the orientation of the animal&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Turner_Evans_2017,Green_2017}</cite>. Those results also inspired a number of modeling attempts at reproducing the physiological phenomenology&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{kakaria_ring_2017,givon_generating_2017,chang_topographical_2017}</cite>&nbsp;All those models make assumptions about the neuronal connectivity based on the degree of overlap at the light microscopy level between pre-synaptic looking and post-synaptic looking processes. We aimed to build&nbsp; a better connectivity diagram based on functional data which will help build and refine models, formulate and test new hypothesis and ultimately understand the structure. The map being constructed is not meant as definitive, but as a source of information, a framework, for the growing central complex community.</div><div>The urge to obtain circuit diagrams is as old as the advent of modern neurosciences. Cajal and Golgi used sparse labeling techniques to reveal circuit architectures. Methods based on marking a discrete subset of neurons and imaging them with light microscopy has recently been revived in the form of stochastic genetic labeling techniques&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Livet_2007,Hampel_2011,Nern_2015,Lee_2001,Chiang_2011}</cite>&nbsp;and photoactivatable fluorophores&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Patterson_2002,Ruta_2010}</cite>. They allow to obtain the detailed anatomy of a large number of individual neurons. But even when used in combination with synaptic markers&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Nicolai_2010,8229205,Zhang_2002,Fouquet_2009}</cite>, they do not offer definitive evidence of synaptic connections, as they rely solely on the proximity between putative pre and post-synaptic compartments. Moreover, they evidently do not provide any insight into the functional properties of connections. Despite those shortcomings, light-level imaging constitutes a good starting point : it allows to establish with relative ease a list of possible connections for large neuron populations.</div><div>More recently, serial electron microscopy reconstruction imposed itself as the gold standard for connectomics (XX). Ideally, it allows to unambiguously identify synapses between all neurons in a given volume. As game-changing as it is, it also suffers a few limitations. Acquiring, processing and analyzing the data is still painstakingly slow. As a result, sample sizes are typically limited to one animal. As any method based on anatomy, functional information is also missing. As of now it is not possible to definitely attribute neurotransmitter types to given synapses, nor to detect gap-junctions. Finally, if one generally assumes the strength of the connection between two neurons scales with the number of synapses, the inability to gauge synaptic strength renders those assumption fragile. <b>(a sentence about the large number of nearly silent synapses at the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell connection ?).</b></div><div>Functional methods address some of those drawbacks. Simple measures of activity have been used to assess a form of functional connectivity : regions or neurons whose activity is correlated -- either spontaneously or during a given task -- are deemed connected. This has been used with EEG, fMRI and MEG recordings in humans to establish maps at the brain region level <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Salvador_2004,Stam_2004}</cite>(<b>review ref ?</b>) and with multi-electrode recordings in&nbsp;<b>XX to evaluate connection probabilities ?... (XX)</b>. In the central complex, such functional correlations have been used in the locust and monarch butterfly to suggest pathways on the basis of response profiles to light polarization orientation (<b>XX</b>). As stated, those methods are correlative, and can't provide a causal account of the connectivity.</div><div>To obtain a causal description of functional connectivity -- sometimes termed effective connectivity -- one needs to either stimulate one node of the network while recording from another one, or record both at sufficiently high resolution as to detect hallmarks of direct connectivity. The most reliable application of such an idea is the paired patch-clamp recording. It identifies connected pairs and their functional properties with a high level of detail, but suffers from low throughput. The development of optogenetics in recent years expanded the toolkit for simultaneous stimulation and recording experiments. (<b>PARSE RODENT LITTERATURE</b>). In drosophila, the ease of use of genetic reagents renders those approaches particularly attractive. Combinations of P2X2 and GCaMP&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{yao_analysis_2012}</cite>, P2X2 and patch-clamp recordings <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hu_functional_2010}</cite>, Channelrhodopsin 2 and patch-clamp <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{gruntman_integration_2013}</cite>, CsChrimson and GCaMP (<cite><a href="#hampel_neural_2015">Hampel et al., 2015;</a>&nbsp;<a href="#zhou_central_2015">Zhou et al., 2015;</a>&nbsp;<a href="#ohyama_multilevel_2015">Ohyama et al., 2015</a></cite>) have been used in individual studies to highlight a small number of connections.&nbsp;Those methods operate at a lower resolution than paired-recordings, in the sense that they usually establish connectivity between cell types, as defined by the genetic driver lines used, rather than between individual neurons. They are also ambiguous as far the the directness of the connections are concerned (<b>see results/discussion</b>) and are limited by the sensitivity of the sensors used. Despite those shortcomings, they constitute a good compromise as they still provide causal, as well as functional, connectivity information, and thus at a much higher throughput than double patch recordings. It is also worth noting that the advantages and limitations of those techniques complement almost perfectly those of serial EM reconstructions. We therefore chose to bring one of those techniques at scale by systematically repeating the experiment with genetically defined pairs of central complex cell types, therefore building a near-complete map of functional connections in the structure at cell-type resolution.</div><h2 data-label="946238" class="ltx_title_subsection">Cell types and information flow in the central complex</h2><div>The central complex consists of three main neuropiles -- the protocerebral bridge (PB), the ellipsoid body (EB, central body lower in non drosophila species) and the fan-shaped body (FB, central body upper in non-drosophila species) -- and at least three accessory neuropiles -- the noduli (NO), the gall (GA), the lateral accessory lobe (LAL)  (<b>references and figure</b>). The most striking neural elements of the central complex are the&nbsp;<i>columnar neurons</i> : those innervate one of the sixteen glomeruli of the PB, one columnar section of either the PB or EB, and one accessory neuropile. The column correspondances between the PB and EB/FB, are stereotypical, and a total of XX different such types have been described. To those "principal cells" one need to add a number of neurons innervating accross several columns, often inside subdivisions orthogonal to the columns, sometimes in addition to neuropiles outside . These includes the ring neurons, which innervate the circumference of the EB and the bulb (BU), FB and PB interneurons and potential input elements (<b>do we want to develop this ?</b>). From this light level anatomy and putative synaptic polarity, one can derive an hypothetical general information flow diagram of the central complex (<b>figure</b>) :</div><ul><li>ring neurons feed inputs into the EB columnar neurons.&nbsp;</li><li>Recurrent connections between EB columnar neurons are present, and thought to sustain the formation of the ring attractor</li><li>Information is transferred from the EB columnar system to the FB columnar system via the PB (interestingly, only one columnar neuron displays presynaptic terminals in the PB, an EB-PB-Gall neuron)</li><li>FB columnar neurons also receive inputs in the FB</li><li>All columnar neurons also receive inputs in the PB</li><li>Interneurons in the PB and FB further interconnect the columns</li><li>All accessory structures are potential outputs&nbsp;</li></ul><div>We show that this overall flow of information is generally supported functionally for the parts we have tested so far, with a few twists : connectivity in the PB is very sparse, accessory structures are usually input areas, and consequently output channels of the CX are scarce.
