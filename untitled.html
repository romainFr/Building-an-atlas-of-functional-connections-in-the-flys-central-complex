<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Abstract</h1><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Positioned in the middle of the insect's brain, the central complex provides a unique opportunity to get mechanistic insights into the way brains build and use abstract representations. Some neurons of the central complex contain a map of the animal's heading. If this map was initially discovered (in the XX) in relation to sky polarization orientation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Heinze_2007}</cite>, it was subsequently shown that it exists independently of the sensory modality providing the orientation cues&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Seelig_2015}</cite>. Independently, neurogenetic studies disrupting the normal physiology of the structure have pointed to a variety of roles for the structure, including motor coordination&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Poeck_2008}</cite>, sensory-motor adaptations&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Triphan_2010}</cite>, or spatial memory&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Neuser_2008,Ofstad_2011}</cite>. It is likely that all those tasks rely on the correct establishment and/or use of the orientation map. Moreover, the scale of the network -- a few thousands neurons in the fly -- and the ease of genetic access to individual cell types in Drosophila melanogaster, renders this circuit tractable within current theoretical and experimental frameworks. Detailed light level anatomy&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Hanesch_1989,Lin_2013,Wolff_2015}</cite> of a significant fraction of the cell types is available, together with the means of genetically targeting those types. This has given rise to the first mechanistic forays into the way the circuit constructs a stable orientation representation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kim_2017}</cite>, and how this representation shifts with together with the orientation of the animal&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Turner_Evans_2017,Green_2017}</cite>. Those results also inspired a number of modeling attempts at reproducing the physiological phenomenology <cite><a href="#kakaria_ring_2017">(Kakaria 2017,</a> <a href="#chang_topographical_2017">Chang 2017,</a> <a href="#givon_generating_2016">Givon 2016)</a></cite>. All those models make assumptions about the neuronal connectivity based on the degree of overlap at the light microscopy level between pre-synaptic looking and post-synaptic looking processes. We aimed to build&nbsp; a better connectivity diagram based on functional data which will help build and refine models, formulate and test new hypothesis and ultimately understand the structure. The map being constructed is not meant as definitive, but as a source of information, a framework, for the growing central complex community.</div><div>TO INSERT SOMEWHERE: in other insect species, pathways have been hypothetized based on correlations between the functional responses of the recorded cell types</div><div>The urge to obtain circuit diagrams is as old as the advent of modern neurosciences. Cajal and Golgi used sparse labeling techniques to reveal circuit architectures. Methods based on marking a discrete subset of neurons and imaging them with light microscopy has recently been revived in the form of multicolor flip-out techniques (XX) + MARCM + PA-GFP. They allow to obtain the detailed anatomy of a large number of individual neurons. But even when used in combination with synaptic markers (XX), they do not offer definitive evidence of synaptic connections.</div><h1 class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h1 class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h2 data-label="904016" class="ltx_title_subsection">An intermediate connectomics approach</h2><div>It is generally accepted that a full understanding of neural circuits requires a complete description of the connections between neurons. Such a “connectome”, within the framework described by Marr, which distinguishes computations, algorithms and implementations as the three necessary levels of description, allow us to bridge the implementation and the algorithmic level. It is thought of as the structural basis onto which computations occur. Modern neuroscience has concerned itself with the elucidation of the connectome since its inception with the work of Cajal. A variety of approaches have been used. Some methods rely on morphology : sparse labeling (Golgi staining, multicolor flip-outs) and&nbsp; tractographic techniques infer the plausible connections based on anatomy at the neuron or brain region scale. Axonal tracing, and more recently serial reconstruction of large electron microscopy volumes, unambiguously identify cells synaptically connected to each other. A different set of methods rely on neural activity : paired recordings can identify and characterize in great detail the nature of the connection between two given neurons, while multi-unit recordings, EEG or fMRI have been used to measure the extend to which neurons and/or brain regions activity correlate. Such correlative descriptions are usually termed  "functional connectivity" by opposition with "effective connectivity", in the sense that it's not a causal account of the relationships between neuron. In the rest of the manuscript, we will however use the words "functional connectivity" to mean "effective functional connectivity".</div><div>Traditionally, morphological methods tend to produce a more complete image of the connectivity in the sense that they cover a larger proportion of the neurons or areas under study, but they are lacking the functional richness present in activity based methods : the strength and sign of the connections are not directly inferable from those results. On the other side, functional methods are either sparse (in the case of paired recordings) or&nbsp;failing to provide a causal description of the connectivity. Taking advantage of the toolkit available in drosophila melanogaster, we propose an intermediate approach allowing us to map effective functional connectivity at cell resolution with the means of attaining completeness.  We applied this method to the central complex of the fly :&nbsp; by using a combination of optogenetics and calcium imaging (as seen in <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealp{hampel_neural_2015,zhou_central_2015,ohyama_multilevel_2015}</cite>), and systematically repeating the experiment with genetically defined pairs of neurons, we built a map of functional connections in the structure.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="421494" class="ltx_title_subsection">Making functional connectomics data easily accessible</h2><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">A functional connectivity screen</h2><div></div>
