Most of the times both the brain and the ventral nerve chord (VNC) were dissected out, as we found that having the VNC still attached to the brain provided better mechanical stability to the preparation. The dissection was realized using the minimum level of illumination possible to avoid spurious activation of CsChrimson, in the same saline subsequently used for the experiment. Brains were positioned anterior part up, except when the connection tested was thought to be in the protocerebral bridge, where they were turned posterior side up to maximize light access close to the supposed synaptic site. Tracheas were removed, and when a pharmacological application was planned, the glial sheath was gently torn to enhance drug access to the neuropiles.</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Imaging conditions and trials structure</h2><div>Imaging was done on a 2-photon scanning microscope (PrairieTechnologies, Bruker). Excitation wavelength was 920nm. Imaging fields of view were chosen as to avoid scanning regions containing the CsChrimson pattern. CsChrimson was excited with trains of 2 ms 590 nm light pulses via a LED shining through the objective. Instantaneous power measured out of the objective was roughly 50μW/mm 2 . Trains were delivered at 30Hz. The number of pulses was varied between 1,5,10, 20 and 30. Each experimental run consisted of 4 repeats each approximately 20 seconds long. Runs were themselves repeated every 2 minutes(approximately).</div><div></div><h2 id="auto-label-subsection-757099" class="ltx_title_subsection">Pharmacology</h2><div>For blocking nicotinergic or inhibitory (GABAergic or glutamatergic) transmission, mecamylamine (50μM) or picrotoxin (10μM) (<b>refs for drugs</b>) were administered through the perfusion by switching to a different line for 3 minutes, followed by a wash period during which the perfusion was drug-free again. 30 pulses stimulations runs were repeated every 2 minutes starting 4 minutes the drug application and throughout the wash.</div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div>Analysis</div><div></div><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">A useful ressource for a growing community</h2><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Inputs to the central complex</h2><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Sparse connectivity and bottlenecks</h2><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Scarcity of output channels</h2><h1 class="ltx_title_section">Discussion</h1><div></div>
