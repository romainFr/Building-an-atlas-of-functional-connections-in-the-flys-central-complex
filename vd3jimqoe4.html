<div>All the individual responses, in the context of the overall connectivity diagram, are being made available at&nbsp;<a href="http://romainfr.github.io/CX-Functional-Website/">romainfr.github.io/CX-Functional-Website/</a>, a website allowing the results of this screen to be explored interactively. We plan to update this website as more similar experiments will be performed. Potentially other sources of data could be merged, making this website an exhaustive source of information about the central complex.&nbsp;</div><div>Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>&nbsp;outlines some of the observed connectivity patterns. 3 types of inputs were isolated (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>C) : ring neurons provide inhibitory inputs to the wedge columnar neurons, as suggested by (<b>REF</b>).
