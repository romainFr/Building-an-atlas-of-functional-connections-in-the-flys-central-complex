<div>All the individual responses, in the context of the overall connectivity diagram, are  available at&nbsp;<a href="http://romainfr.github.io/CX-Functional-Website/">romainfr.github.io/CX-Functional-Website/</a>, a website allowing the results of this screen to be explored interactively. We plan to update this website as further experiments are performed. The website could also be expanded to accommodate other sources of data, making it an exhaustive source of information about the central complex.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>&nbsp;outlines some of the observed connectivity patterns. Three types of inputs were isolated (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>C): ring neurons provide inhibitory inputs to the wedge columnar neurons, as suggested by (<b>REF</b>). One of the ring neurons we examined, the gall ring neuron, likely participates in a feedback loop, because it  receives excitatory input from  P-EG neurons. One class of LAL-NO interneurons provides another class of inhibitory input into the EB columnar system by targeting the P-EN neurons. It is likely that other types of LAL-NO interneurons innervating other noduli compartment target P-FN neurons, but these pairs have not been tested extensively yet. Finally, several columnar neurons share excitatory inputs in the PB, from a PB-IB-SPS neuron. In contrast, we found few potential output channels. The only such identified in this dataset is presented in figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>B and connects the P-FL columnar neuron&nbsp; to a LAL interneuron. It is worth noting here that FB tangential neurons having been left out of this screen, some outputs might be present there.</div>
