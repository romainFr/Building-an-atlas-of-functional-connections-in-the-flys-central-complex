<h2 data-label="142652" class="ltx_title_subsection">The central complex functional connectome </h2><div>Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>&nbsp;outlines some of the connectivity patterns we observed. We focus, in particular, on some of the main inputs and outputs relevant to parts of the central complex that we examined (specifically, the ellipsoid body, protocerebral bridge and paired noduli), connectivity within the protocerebral bridge, and components of the ring attractor network within the central complex.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="569600" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Inputs </h3><div>We identified two classes of inhibitory, picrotoxin-sensitive inputs to the central complex. First, the two ring neuron types we tested target the wedge columnar neurons (E-PG, Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>Ai), as has been suggested previously&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mart_n_Pe_a_2014,Hanesch1989,Kahsai2012}</cite>.  Second, a class of LAL-NO interneurons provides another source of inhibitory input into the EB columnar system by targeting the P-EN neurons (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>Aii and&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Aii). This connection is particularly interesting in the light of the finding that the P-EN neurons drive the rotation of the bump of activity in the heading representation system&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Green2017,Turner-Evans2017}</cite>. Since the left/right noduli segregation corresponds to individual cells coding turns in opposite direction&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Turner-Evans2017}</cite>,  the GLAL-NO is likely involved in strengthening and refining those turn related signals. Moreover, it is likely that other types of LAL-NO interneurons innervating other noduli compartments target P-FN neurons, but these pairs have not been tested extensively yet. We did not expect to detect inhibitory responses with GCaMP, but it was possible because —at least in some cell types— fluctuations in baseline activity occasionally elevated GCaMP levels during the experiment (see Discussion and Supplementary Figure <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{998826}</span>). Therefore, even though hyperpolarization below resting potential is likely not detectable through calcium imaging, we could detect inhibition from an excited state as a dip in the fluorescence trace. Finally, several columnar neurons share excitatory inputs in the PB, from an IS-P  neuron (PB.b-IB.s-SPS.s, Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>Aiii). In contrast, we found few potential output channels.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The only output pathway identified in this dataset is presented in figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>C, and connects the PF3-LCre columnar neuron&nbsp;to an LAL interneuron. Note that FB tangential neurons, which we did not include in our experiments, may contribute potential output pathways as well.</div>
