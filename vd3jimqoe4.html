<div>All the individual responses and statistics, in the context of the overall connectivity diagram, are  available at&nbsp;<a href="http://romainfr.github.io/CX-Functional-Website/">romainfr.github.io/CX-Functional-Website/</a>, a website allowing the results of this screen to be explored interactively. We plan to update this website as further experiments are performed. The website could also be expanded to accommodate other sources of data, making it an exhaustive source of information about the central complex.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>&nbsp;outlines some of the observed connectivity patterns. Three types of inputs were isolated (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>C): ring neurons provide inhibitory inputs to the wedge columnar neurons (Figure <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>Ai), as was suggested previously&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Hanesch1989,Kahsai_2012,Mart_n_Pe_a_2014}</cite>. One of the ring neurons we examined, the gall ring neuron, likely participates in a feedback loop, because it  receives excitatory input from  P-EG neurons (Figure ). One class of LAL-NO interneurons provides another class of inhibitory input into the EB columnar system by targeting the P-EN neurons (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>Aii). It is likely that other types of LAL-NO interneurons innervating other noduli compartment target P-FN neurons, but these pairs have not been tested extensively yet. Finally, several columnar neurons share excitatory inputs in the PB, from a PB-IB-SPS neuron (Figure <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>Aiii). In contrast, we found few potential output channels. The only such pathway identified in this dataset is presented in figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>C and connects the PF3-LALCre columnar neuron&nbsp;to a LAL interneuron. It is important to note here that FB tangential neurons, which we did not include in our experiments, may contribute potential output pathways as well.</div>
