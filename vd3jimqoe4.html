<div>All the individual responses, in the context of the overall connectivity diagram, are being made available at&nbsp;<a href="http://romainfr.github.io/CX-Functional-Website/">romainfr.github.io/CX-Functional-Website/</a>, a website allowing the results of this screen to be explored interactively. We plan to update this website as more similar experiments will be performed. Potentially other sources of data could be merged, making this website an exhaustive source of information about the central complex.&nbsp;</div><div>Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>&nbsp;outlines some of the observed connectivity patterns. 3 types of inputs were isolated (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>C) : ring neurons provide inhibitory inputs to the wedge columnar neurons, as suggested by (<b>REF</b>). Interestingly, the gall ring neuron we used here seem to be involved in some form of feedback loop, as it also receives excitatory input from P-EG neurons. One class of LAL-NO interneurons provides another class of inhibitory input into the EB columnar system by targeting the P-EN neurons. It is likely that other types of LAL-NO interneurons innervating other noduli compartment target P-FN neurons, but those pairs have not been tested extensively yet. Finally, several columnar neurons share excitatory inputs in the PB, from a PB-IB-SPS neuron. In contrast, potential output channels are very scarce. The only identified in this dataset is presented in figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>B and connects the P-FL columnar neuron&nbsp; to a LAL interneuron. It is worth noting here that FB tangential neurons havi</div>
