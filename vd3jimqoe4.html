<h2 data-label="142652" class="ltx_title_subsection">The central complex functional connectome </h2><div>Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>&nbsp;outlines some of the connectivity patterns we observed. We focus, in particular, on some of the main inputs and outputs relevant to parts of the central complex that we examined (specifically, the ellipsoid body, protocerebral bridge and paired noduli), connectivity within the protocerebral bridge, and components of the ring attractor network within the central complex.</div><div></div><div>Three types of inputs were isolated (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>A). First, ring neurons provide inhibitory input to the wedge columnar neurons (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>Ai), as has been suggested previously&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mart_n_Pe_a_2014,Hanesch1989,Kahsai2012}</cite>. One of the ring neurons we examined, the gall ring neuron, likely participates in a feedback loop, because it  receives excitatory input from  P-EG neurons (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>Di). Second, one class of LAL-NO interneurons provides another source of inhibitory input into the EB columnar system by targeting the P-EN neurons (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>Aii). It is likely that other types of LAL-NO interneurons innervating other noduli compartments target P-FN neurons, but these pairs have not been tested extensively yet. Finally, several columnar neurons share excitatory inputs in the PB, from an IS-P  neuron (PB.b-IB.s-SPS.s, Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>Aiii). In contrast, we found few potential output channels. The only output pathway identified in this dataset is presented in figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>C, and connects the PF3-LCre columnar neuron&nbsp;to an LAL interneuron. Note that FB tangential neurons, which we did not include in our experiments, may contribute potential output pathways as well.</div>
