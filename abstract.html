<div>The  central complex is a highly conserved insect brain region composed  of morphologically stereotyped neurons that arborize in distinctively  shaped substructures. The region has been implicated in a wide range of  behaviors, including  navigation, motor control and sleep, and has been  the subject of several modeling studies exploring its circuit computations. Most  studies so far have relied on assumptions about  connectivity between neurons in the region based  on their overlap in  light-level&nbsp;microscopic images. Here, we present an extensive functional  connectome of&nbsp;<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>'s central complex at  cell-type resolution. Using simultaneous optogenetic stimulation  GCaMP recordings and pharmacology, we tested the connectivity between  over 70  presynaptic-to-postsynaptic cell-type pairs. The results reveal  a range of inputs to the central complex, some of which had not been  previously described, and suggest that the central complex has a   limited number of output channels. Additionally, despite the  high degree of  recurrence in the circuit,   network connectivity appears to be  sparser  than anticipated from light-level images. Finally, the connectivity  matrix we obtained highlights the potentially critical role of a class  of bottleneck interneurons of the protocerebral bridge known as the Î”7  neurons. All data  is provided for interactive exploration in a&nbsp;<a href="https://romainfr.github.io/CX-Functional-Website/" target="_blank">website</a> with the capacity to accommodate additional connectivity information as it becomes available. Raw data and code are made available as an&nbsp;<a href="https://osf.io/vsa3z/" target="_blank">OpenScienceFramework project</a>.</div>
