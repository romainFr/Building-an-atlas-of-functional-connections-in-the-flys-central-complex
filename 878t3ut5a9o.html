<div>Finally, connectivity in the PB is much sparser than predicted solely from anatomy (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>A). The main observation is that the E-PG, the only columnar type presynaptic in the PB, seems to not being connected directly to any of the other columnar neurons in the PB. This connection is indirect, through the&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta7\)</span> interneurons, which therefore seem to constitute an important bottleneck in the system.&nbsp;</div><div>Placeholder for conclusion paragraph.&nbsp;</div><h1>Discussion</h1><div>The presented dataset will constitute a useful ressource for the growing community of researchers interested in the central complex. Whereas similar coarse functional connectivity techniques have been used in individual studies, this is to our knowledge the first extensive dataset of this kind. It will hopefully become an evolving source of information, which will take its full value when combined with other data source : in our opinion, coarse functional connectivity associated with EM-level anatomical connectivity and high resolution gene expression profiles would constitute a very solid base to shape constrained models of the structure and form detailed hypothesis. As any large dataset, it is mainly a starting point for more detailed research.&nbsp;</div><div>It is worth elaborating on the limitations of the method to insure a correct interpretation of the data presented. First, the combination of CsChrimson and GCaMP does not strictly insure that the responses observed are direct. However, the large set of non overlapping controls provides a statistical framework to interpret the results in that respect -- uncertainty is only present for weak connections. A more pressing issue concerns the sensitivity.&nbsp; What can be detected&nbsp;is bounded by the stimulation protocol and the sensitivity of GCaMP6-m.&nbsp;This means that an absence of response cannot be formally be interpreted as an absence of connection. The fact that inhibitory responses are visible, and that clear responses saturate with the range of stimulations used (see supplementary figure&nbsp;<b>XX</b>) is reassuring, but it is likely that EM-level anatomy will reveal that a fraction of the weak synaptic connections have been missed, and will need to be investigated using more sensitive, likely electrophysiological, methods. In general, comparing results from different methods will point at specific points of interest requiring more detailed studies. Finally, the&nbsp;full-field stimulation of full neuronal type populations protocol used here has a couple of drawbacks. We have no access to connectivity between neurons of the same class, and potential unphysiological network effects could arise. One such effect would be the recruitment of global inhibitory feedbacks. However, when we suspected this could&nbsp;be a possibility, we controlled for it using pharmacology, and never saw evidence of a significant effect (supplementary figure&nbsp;<b>XX</b>). Overall, it should be kept in mind that this dataset is a starting point to be interpreted with caution, a framework from which to build hypothesis and ask questions.&nbsp;</div><div>One intriguing observation is the fact that the fluorescence baseline tended to fluctuate spontaneously during the course of the experiments. Whereas it allowed us to detect inhibitory responses, we noticed that excitatory responses were also occasionally depending on this baseline (supplementary figure&nbsp;<b>XX</b>). One possible interpretation of this effect is that it reflects some form of brain state (either a network state or a neuromodulatory state).&nbsp; This raises the concern that such state is not controlled in our brain in a dish preparation, when some connections might depend on it. The fact that the baseline is so variable suggests that at least, some range of such states is covered during those experiments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>The connectivity matrix obtained is, unsurprisingly, sparser than what the light level anatomy would predict. This has a number of interesting consequences.&nbsp; First, the&nbsp;&nbsp;Δ7 interneurons appear to be a bottleneck for information processed in the protocerebral bridge. This is all the more interesting given the range of responses evoked by&nbsp;&nbsp;Δ7 stimulation (supplementary figure&nbsp;<b>XX</b>). Potentially, synaptic properties at the&nbsp;Δ7 synapses could play a primary role in the way the heading emerges in the EB columnar system and how it is transferred to the FB columnar system. Moreover, it seems that the network contains very few (<b>XX</b> in the pairs tested) excitatory feedforward chains or reciprocal excitatory connections. This raises the question of how activity is maintained in the structure given the wealth of inhibitory inputs it receives.
