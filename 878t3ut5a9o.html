<div>Finally, functional connectivity in the PB is much sparser than predicted solely from anatomy (Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{704309}</span>A). The main observation is that the E-PG, the only columnar type that is presynaptic in the PB, seems to not be strongly  connected  to any of the other columnar neurons in the PB. Although we could observe a connection with stronger activation <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Turner-Evans2017}</cite>, we believe the connection to be mediated through the&nbsp;Δ7 interneurons, which therefore seem to constitute an important bottleneck in the system.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Placeholder for conclusion paragraph.&nbsp;</div><h1></h1><h1>Discussion</h1><div>The  dataset presented in this study will constitute a useful resource for the growing community of researchers interested in the central complex. While similar coarse functional connectivity techniques have been used in individual studies, this is, to our knowledge, the first extensive dataset of this kind. We hope that it will become an evolving source of information, which will be most useful when combined with other complementary data sources, such&nbsp; as EM-level anatomical connectivity and high resolution gene expression profiles. Such combined data would constitute a very solid base to build constrained models of the central complex's networks and generate detailed hypotheses of its function. As with any large dataset, we see this effort as mainly a starting point for more detailed research.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The connectivity technique we applied has several limitations that are important to keep in mind when interpreting our results. First, the combination of CsChrimson and GCaMP does not guarantee that the connections observed are direct and monosynaptic. However, the large set of non overlapping controls provides a statistical framework to interpret the results in that respect — not surprisingly, uncertainty is highest for weak connections. A more pressing issue concerns  sensitivity: what can be detected&nbsp;is limited by the stimulation protocol and the sensitivity of GCaMP6m.&nbsp;Thus, an absence of a post-synaptic response cannot be  interpreted as an absence of a connection. The fact that inhibitory responses are visible, and that strong responses saturate with the range of stimulations used (see supplementary figure&nbsp;<b>XX</b>) is reassuring, but it is likely that EM-level anatomy will reveal that some fraction of  weak synaptic connections have been missed by this technique, and will need to be investigated using more sensitive, likely electrophysiological, methods. Further, we relied on&nbsp;full-field stimulation of entire populations of specific neuronal types, a protocol with its own drawbacks: this approach provides no access to connectivity between neurons of the same class, and does not account for potential unphysiological network effects. One such effect would be the recruitment of global inhibitory networks that masks an otherwise excitatory connection. However, whenever we suspected this could&nbsp;be a possibility, we controlled for it using pharmacology, and never saw evidence of a significant effect (supplementary figure&nbsp;<b>XX</b>). Finally, all our experiments were performed on brains in a dish. Given the variety of neuromodulators that operate in the central complex (<b>Ref</b>), it is possible that functional connectivity&nbsp;within this region is modulated by brain state. Consistent with this possibility, We often saw that the fluorescence baseline tended to fluctuate spontaneously during the course of the experiments. Although increases in baseline activity allowed us to detect inhibitory responses, we noticed that excitatory responses  also occasionally depended on this baseline fluctuation (supplementary figure&nbsp;<b>XX</b>).&nbsp;</div>
