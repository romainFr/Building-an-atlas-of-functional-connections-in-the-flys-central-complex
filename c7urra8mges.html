We used the set of non overlapping pairs as a control (the null sample). Considering only two parameters, the scaled normalized integral and the  correlation across flies (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>), we calculated the Mahalanobis distance between the null sample and each data point, using a robust estimate of the covariance matrix&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Rousseeuw_1999}</cite> of the null sample. While single statistics never were sufficient to capture all relevant aspects of the response, we found that these two measurements recapitulated well distance measurements obtained by combining all the statistics. We then computed 99% confidence intervals  on the distribution of distances by bootstrapping to determine significance. </div><div></div><h1 data-label="210815" class="ltx_title_section">Acknowledgments</h1><div>We are grateful to Tanya Wolff and Arnim Jenett for help selecting the driver lines, to Janelia FlyCore and Karen Hibbard in particular for providing assistance in setting the initial crosses.
