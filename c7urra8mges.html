We used the set of non overlapping experiments as a control non-connected sample. Considering only two parameters, the scaled normalized integral and the repeats correlation, we calculated the Mahalanobis distance between the null sample and each data point, using a robust estimate of the covariance matrix (<b>ref fastMCD</b>) of the null sample. We then computed confidence intervals on the distance distribution by bootstrapping to determine significance. This was done both by run and by cell pair run. </div><div></div><div></div>
