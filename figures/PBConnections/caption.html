<div data-label="704309"><b>Figure 5.</b>&nbsp;Selected connectivity motifs within the central complex. A: Input channels. (i) Ring neurons provide inhibitory input to the E-PGs in the EB. (ii) GL-N1 inhibits P-EN neurons. (iii) Distributed excitatory input from IS-P neurons in the PB. B: Î”7 is probably the bottleneck in PB motifs, as it is the only strong post-synaptic target of E-PG neurons. C: The only output pair found so far connects the PF3-LCre neuron to an LAL interneuron. D: Recurrence in the central complex. (i) at the input stage, and (ii) within the EB columnar system</div>
