<div data-label="704309">Connectivity motifs of the central complex. A Input channels. i Ring neurons provide inhibitory input to the E-PGs in the EB, while Gall ring neurons seem to form a feedback loop through the P-EGs. ii GLAL-NO1 inhibits P-EN neurons. iii Distributed excitatory input from IBSPS-PB neurons in the PB. B Î”7 is probably the bottleneck in PB motifs, as it's the only solid target of E-PG neurons. C The only output pair found to this day connects the P-F3LAL neuron to a LAL interneuron.
