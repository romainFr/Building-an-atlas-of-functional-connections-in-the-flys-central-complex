<div data-label="489066"><b>Figure 3.</b>  Characterization of  calcium transients observed in response to optogenetic stimulation. A and B : Summary of different response types. Stimulation is indicated by the gray bar and consists of 20 light pulses (50 µW/mm<sup>2</sup>, each of 2 ms duration) delivered at 30 Hz. A: Example neuron pairs, simple responses. (i) PF-LCre to SMPL-L. (ii) GL-N1 to P-EN1. (iii) GL-N1 to L-Ei. B: Example neuron pairs, unclear responses. (i) E-PG to P-F3N2d. (ii) Δ7 to P-F1N3. (iii) Δ7 to P-EG. In A and B, all responses, expressed as ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, are baseline subtracted except for the inhibitory response in Aii. Scale bar 2 s. C: Example of statistics computed on individual runs and cell pairs. Q(i) Characterizing the average response shape. (ii) Characterizing the reliability of the response. (iii) Characterizing response sensitivity. D: Using the distribution of statistics from non-overlapping controls to assign classes to the responses : distributions of responses amplitudes and reliability as measured by the scaled normalized integral (the median of the integral normalized to the baseline and scaled so that the dataset spans the [-1,1] range) and the between-flies correlation (see Materials and Methods). Each point corresponds to a different cell pair (median statistics across flies). Control unconnected pairs are shown in blue, and same-cell-type-stimulation in orange. Responses considered significantly different from the control sample (p&lt;0.01, see Materials and Methods) are circled.&nbsp;</div>
