<div data-label="489066">Responses characterization. A Example neuron pairs, simple responses. i&nbsp;PF-LALCre to SMPLAL-LAL. ii GLAL-NO1 to P-EN1. iii GLAL-NO1 to LAL-Ei. B Example neuron pairs, unclear responses. i E-PG to P-F3N2d. ii Δ7 to P-F1N3. iii&nbsp;Δ7 to P-EG. In A and B, all responses are baseline substracted except for the inhibitory response in Aii. Scale bar 2 seconds, 1ΔF/F.

Control non connected experiments are in blue, and self stimulation in green. Responses considered significantly different from the control sample (p&lt;0.01, see Methods) are circled. </div>
