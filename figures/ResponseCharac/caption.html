<div data-label="489066"><b>Figure 3.</b>  Summary of different response types. A: Example neuron pairs, simple responses. (i) PF-LAL-Cre to SMP-LAL-LAL. (ii) GLAL-NO1 to P-EN1. (iii) GLAL-NO1 to LAL-Ei. B: Example neuron pairs, unclear responses. (i) E-PG to P-F3N2d. (ii) Δ7 to P-F1N3. (iii) Δ7 to P-EG. In A and B, all responses are baseline subtracted except for the inhibitory response in Aii. Scale bar 2 seconds, 1ΔF/F. C: Example of statistics computed on individual runs and cell pairs.&nbsp; D: Using the distribution of statistics from non-overlapping controls to assign classes to the responses. (i) Responses of all the non-overlapping pairs. Occasional responses are seen, but those are never reliable. Each color corresponds to a cell pair. (ii) Distributions of responses amplitudes and reliability as measured by the scaled normalized integral and the repeat to repeat correlation (see Materials and Methods). Control non-connected pairs are shown in blue, and same-cell-type-stimulation in green. Responses considered significantly different from the control sample (p&lt;0.01, see Materials and Methods) are circled.&nbsp;</div>
