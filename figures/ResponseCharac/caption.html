<div data-label="489066"><b>Figure 3.</b>  Summary of different response types. A: Example neuron pairs, simple responses. (i) PF-LALCre to SMPLAL-LAL. (ii) GLAL-NO1 to P-EN1. (iii) GLAL-NO1 to LAL-Ei. B: Example neuron pairs, unclear responses. (i) E-PG to P-F3N2d. (ii) Δ7 to P-F1N3. (iii) Δ7 to P-EG. In A and B, all responses are baseline substracted except for the inhibitory response in Aii. Scale bar 2 seconds, 1ΔF/F. C: Example of statistics computed on individual runs and cell pairs.&nbsp; D: Using the distribution of statistics from non overlapping controls to assign classes to the responses. (i) Responses of all the non overlapping pairs. Occasional responses are seen, but those are never reliable. Each color corresponds to a cell pair. (ii) Distributions of responses amplitudes and reliability as measured by the scaled normalized integral and the repeat to repeat correlation (see Materials and Methods). Control non connected experiments are in blue, and self stimulation in green. Responses considered significantly different from the control sample (p&lt;0.01, see MaterMethods) are circled.&nbsp;</div>
