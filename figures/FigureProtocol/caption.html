<div data-label="831433">A functional connectivity screen. A : Schematics of the neurons considered for the screen. The example neurons shown in B and C are indicated by the orange boxes. B : For each potential neuronal pair, driver lines with clean expression in the central complex are selected -- the orange boxes delineate the approximate position of the neurons of interest in the brain. C : To determine if a given pair is a valuable candidate, the degree of overlap between the expression patterns is observed on anatomy images aligned on a common brain template. If the patterns overlap (blue ellipse)&nbsp;</div>
