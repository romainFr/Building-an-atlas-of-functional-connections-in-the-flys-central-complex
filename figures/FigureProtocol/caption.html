<div data-label="831433"><b>Figure 2.</b> A functional connectivity screen. A: Schematics of a subset of the neurons considered for the screen. The example neurons shown in B and C are indicated by blue and orange dotted-line boxes. B: For each potential neuronal pair, driver lines with clean expression in the central complex were selected â€” the  boxes delineate the approximate position of the neurons of interest in the brain. C: To determine if a given pair is a promising candidate, we examined the degree of overlap between the expression patterns in anatomy images registered to a common brain template. If the patterns overlapped (as indicated by the blue ellipse), we expressed CsChrimson  in the presynaptic candidate, GCaMP6m in the postsynaptic candidate, and then imaged the ex-vivo brain  in a 2-photon laser scanning microscope while optogenetically stimulating the presynaptic candidate population (D).  We selected the region imaged sclose to the overlapping processes, but contained only  GCaMP expressing arbors (yellow ellipse in C).&nbsp;</div>
