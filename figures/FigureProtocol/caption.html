<div data-label="831433"><b>Figure 2.</b> A functional connectivity screen. A: Schematics of some of the neurons considered for the screen. The example neurons shown in B and C are indicated by blue and orange dotted-line boxes. B: For each potential neuronal pair, driver lines with clean expression in the central complex are selected -- the  boxes delineate the approximate position of the neurons of interest in the brain. C: To determine if a given pair is a promising candidate, the degree of overlap between the expression patterns is observed on anatomy images aligned on a common brain template. If the patterns overlap (as indicated by the blue ellipse), CsChrimson is expressed in the presynaptic candidate, GCaMP6-m in the postsynaptic candidate, and the ex-vivo brain is imaged in a 2-photon microscope while stimulating the rhodopsin (D). The region imaged is chosen as to be close to the overlapping processes but containing only the GCaMP expressing neurons (yellow ellipse in C).&nbsp;</div>
