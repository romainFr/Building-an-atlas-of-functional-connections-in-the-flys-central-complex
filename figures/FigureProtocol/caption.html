<div data-label="831433"><b>Figure 2.</b> A functional connectivity screen. A: Schematics ofa&nbsp; of the neurons considered for the screen. The example neurons shown in B and C are indicated by blue and orange dotted-line boxes. B: For each potential neuronal pair, driver lines with clean expression in the central complex are selected -- the  boxes delineate the approximate position of the neurons of interest in the brain. C: To determine if a given pair is a promising candidate, the degree of overlap between the expression patterns is observed on anatomy images aligned on a common brain template. If the patterns overlap (as indicated by the blue ellipse), CsChrimson is expressed in the presynaptic candidate, GCaMP6m in the postsynaptic candidate, and the ex-vivo brain is imaged in a 2-photon microscope while stimulating the rhodopsin (D). The region imaged is chosen to be close to the overlapping processes, but containing only the GCaMP expressing neurons (yellow ellipse in C).&nbsp;</div>
