<div data-label="488013">Supplementary Figure: mecamylamine application. For each cell pair, the right plot correspond to the average traces (+-s.e.m.) at three time points during  drug application: before (in blue, 4 minutes preceding  drug application), during (in orange 10 to 15 minutes after starting  drug application) and after (in gray, last two runs of the experiment). The left plot shows the response integral as a function of time to the drug application. Each color corresponds to a fly. Cell pairs are grouped based on the pre-synatic cell type tested. A: Columnar neurons. B: IS-P neuron. C: Others.</div>
