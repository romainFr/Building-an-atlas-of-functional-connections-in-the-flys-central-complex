<div data-label="495744">Anatomical and matrix representations of central complex connectivity. A: Diagrammatic representation. Solid lines indicate anatomically overlapping cell pairs, whereas dotted lines correspond to the non overlapping controls. The thickness of the lines maps to the functional connection strength. B: Matrix representation. Purple squares indicate the connections predicted from the anatomical overlaps. Connection strengths are quantified in terms of the Mahalanobis distance to the null sample, signed by the sign of the response integral and normalized to the maximum response. In A, the reliability of the responses as measured by the between-flies correlations is mapped to the transparency of the connection</div>
