<div data-label="723169">Supplementary Figure: dose responses. Thin lines correspond to median normalized scaled integrals of individual cell pairs. Cell pairs are grouped according to the class of their response (significantly excitatory/inhibitory or non significantly different from the controls). Note that both excitatory and inhibitory responses tend to saturate at 20 pulses.&nbsp;</div>
