<div data-label="384795"><b>Figure 4.</b> Anatomical and matrix  representations of central complex connectivity. A: Diagrammatic representation. Solid lines indicate  anatomically overlapping cell pairs, whereas dotted lines correspond to the non-overlapping controls. B: Matrix representation. Dots indicate the connections predicted from the anatomical overlaps. Connection strengths are given as the Mahalinobis distance to the null sample, signed by the sign of the response integral and normalized to the maximum response. In A the reliability of the </div>
