<div data-label="998826">Supplementary figure : spread of fluorescence baseline, effect on the responses. A Distribution of baseline fluorescence for each cell pair tested. Pairs are colored according to the "anatomical" class they belong to (overlapping, non overlapping and self activation). B Same as A, but pooled by class. C Correlations between the response signed distance and the baseline values of significantly responding pairs. Inhibitory are (as expected) correlated, but excitatory pairs also show a mild correlation. Correlations are a bit weaker for self stimulation experiments. D Example of distance to baseline relationship in 4 pairs. i PF-LALCre to SMPLAL-LAL, corresponding to figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Ai. ii GLAL-NO1 to P-EN1, corresponding to figure&nbsp;</div>
