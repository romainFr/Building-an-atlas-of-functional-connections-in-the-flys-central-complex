<div data-label="998826">Supplementary Figure: spread of fluorescence baseline, effect on the responses. A: Distribution of baseline fluorescence for each cell pair tested. Pairs are colored according to the "anatomical" class they belong to (overlapping, non-overlapping and self-st). B: Same as A, but pooled by class. C: Correlations between the response signed distance and the baseline values of significantly responding pairs. Inhibitory responses are (as expected) correlated, but excitatory pairs also show a mild correlation.  D: Example of distance to baseline relationship in 4 pairs.
