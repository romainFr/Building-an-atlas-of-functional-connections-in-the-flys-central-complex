<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Dissections</h2><div>The brains of 5 to 9 days old female flies were taken out  and laid on a poly-D-lysine coated coverslip (Corning, Corning, NY<b>)</b>. Most of the times both the brain and the ventral nerve chord (VNC) were dissected out, as we found that having the VNC still attached to the brain provided better mechanical stability to the preparation. The dissection was realized using the minimum level of illumination possible to avoid spurious activation of CsChrimson, in  saline containing (in mM) : &nbsp;103 NaCl, 3 KCl, 5 TES, 8 trehalose dihydrate, 10 glucose, 26 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, 4 MgCl2, &nbsp;bubbled with carbogen (95% <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(O_2\)</span>, 5% <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(CO_2\)</span>). Brains were positioned with their anterior part up, except when the connection tested was thought to be in the protocerebral bridge, where they were turned posterior side up to maximize light access close to the supposed synaptic site. Tracheas were removed, and when a pharmacological application was planned, the glial sheath was gently torn with tweezers to enhance drug access to the neuropiles.&nbsp;</div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Imaging conditions and trial structure</h2>
