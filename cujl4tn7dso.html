<h2 data-label="872688" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div> </div><div></div><div>It is important to note two things at this stage. First, non-overlapping pairs usually showed no fluctuations upon stimulation, and when they did, they were small and unreliable (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Di), likely reflecting indirect effects. This suggests that  the effects observed with our stimulation protocol were likely the result of direct synaptic connections. Secondly, and not surprisingly, responses were always detected with same-cell-type-stimulation controls  (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Dii). </div><div></div><div>The resulting connectivity matrix  is shown in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{384795}</span> in two alternative visualizations. All the individual responses and statistics, in the context of the overall connectivity diagram, are  available at&nbsp;<a href="http://romainfr.github.io/CX-Functional-Website/">romainfr.github.io/CX-Functional-Website/</a>, a website allowing the results of this screen to be explored interactively. We plan to update this website as further experiments are performed. The website could also be expanded to accommodate other sources of data, which would make it an exhaustive source of information about the central complex.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
