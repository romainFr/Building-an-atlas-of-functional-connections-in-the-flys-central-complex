<h2 data-label="872688" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div> Since no single measurement could recapitulate the complexity of the observed responses,&nbsp;we decided to summarize the transients obtained with a battery of statistics reflecting the amplitude, shape, reliability and stimulus sensitivity of the response&nbsp;(see figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>B and methods for a full description). Responses of non-overlapping pairs were then used to form the null-hypothesis distributions of the statistics (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>C and S<b>XX</b>). Pairs were considered as connected if significantly outside of this multivariate distribution (see Methods for details), and response strength was measured in terms of the Mahalanobis distance to the null distribution.</div><div>The connectivity matrix obtained is presented in figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{384795}</span>. It is worth noting two things at this stage. First, non-overlapping pairs usually showed no fluctuations upon stimulation, and when they did, those were small and unreliable, likely reflecting indirect effects. This gives us confidence that given our stiu</div><div></div>
