<h2 data-label="872688" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div>All the individual responses and statistics, in the context of the overall connectivity diagram, are  available at&nbsp;<a href="http://romainfr.github.io/CX-Functional-Website/">romainfr.github.io/CX-Functional-Website/</a>, a website allowing the results of this screen to be explored interactively. We plan to update this website as further experiments are performed. The website can also be expanded to accommodate other sources of data, which would make it an exhaustive source of information about the central complex.&nbsp;The connectivity matrix  resulting from our experiments is shown in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{384795}</span> in two alternative visualizations,as a network diagram and a matrix of connection strengths.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
