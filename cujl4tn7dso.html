<h2 data-label="872688" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div> Since no single measurement could recapitulate the complexity of the observed responses,&nbsp;we decided to summarize the transients obtained with a battery of statistics reflecting the amplitude, shape, reliability and stimulus sensitivity of the response&nbsp;(see figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>B and methods for a full description). Responses of non-overlapping pairs were then used to form the null-hypothesis distributions of the statistics (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>C and S<b>XX</b>). Pairs were considered as connected if significantly outside of this multivariate distribution (see Methods for details), and response strength was measured in terms of the Mahalanobis&nbsp;</div><div>Describe matrix obtained, general observations on ground covered/reliability (non overlapping pairs never show responses, proportion of overlapping pairs "responding"+ground truthing based on &nbsp;the non overlapping pairs + estimate the proportion of the network covered at that stage.</div><div>WIP WIP WIP</div>
