<h2 data-label="872688" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div> Since no single characteristic of the responses could adequately capture their variety, variability and complexity,&nbsp; we chose to summarize the transients obtained with a battery of statistics reflecting response amplitude, shape, reliability and stimulus sensitivity &nbsp;(see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>C, Supplementary Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{695432}</span>, and Materials and Methods for a full description). Responses of non-overlapping pairs were then used to form the null-hypothesis distributions of two of the statistics capturing  response amplitude and reliability (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>D). For every data point, the Mahalanobis distance to the mean of the null distribution was computed and pairs were considered as connected if this distance fell significantly outside of the distance distribution  of the null sample  (for details see Materials and Methods).</div><div></div><div>The resulting connectivity matrix  is shown in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{384795}</span>. It is worth noting two things at this stage. First, non-overlapping pairs usually showed no fluctuations upon stimulation, and when they did, those were small and unreliable (see Figure <span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Di), likely reflecting indirect effects. This suggests that  the effects observed with our stimulation protocol were likely the result of direct synaptic connections. Secondly, and not surprisingly, the same-cell-type-stimulation controls were always detected as responding (see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Dii).</div><div></div>
