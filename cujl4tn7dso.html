<h2 data-label="872688" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div> Since no single measurement could recapitulate the complexity of the observed responses — responses come in a range of shapes, reliability and amplitudes — we decided to summarize the transients obtained with a battery of statistics reflecting the amplitude, shape, reliability and stimulus sensitivity of the response&nbsp;(see Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>B and Methods for a full description). Responses of non-overlapping pairs were then used to form the null-hypothesis distributions of the statistics (see figure S<b>XX</b>). Pairs were considered as connected if significantly outside of the multivariate distribution  of the null sample for  two of those statistics capturing the response amplitude and reliability, and response strength  was measured in terms of the Mahalanobis distance to the mean of the null distribution (see figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>D and Methods for details).</div><div>The connectivity matrix obtained is presented in figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{384795}</span>. It is worth noting two things at this stage. First, non-overlapping pairs usually showed no fluctuations upon stimulation, and when they did, those were small and unreliable, likely reflecting indirect effects. This gives us confidence that given our stimulus conditions, the effects observed were usually the result of direct synaptic connections. Secondly, and not surprisingly, the self-activation controls were always detected as responding (see figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>D).</div><div></div>
