  abstract = {Three new algorithms for 2D translation image registration to within a small fraction of a pixel that use nonlinear optimization and matrix-multiply discrete Fourier transforms are compared. These algorithms can achieve registration with an accuracy equivalent to that of the conventional fast Fourier transform upsampling approach in a small fraction of the computation time and with greatly reduced memory requirements. Their accuracy and computation time are compared for the purpose of evaluating a translation-invariant error metric.},
