<div>The range of observed responses is exposed in figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>A. Upon stimulation, effects ranged from a total absence of change (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Avi) to very large reliable transients (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Ai). In between those extremes, transients of variable size and reliability could be observed.</div><div>Interestingly, we could also observe inhibitory responses. This was rendered possible by the fact that -- at least in some cell types -- the baseline fluorescence was fluctuating during the experiment (<b>Quantify the spread of baselines for each cell type</b> and the population if it makes sense) : even if hyperpolarizations below the resting potential are likely not detectable through GCaMP imaging (), inhibition from an excited state do appear as dips in the fluorescence trace (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Aii).&nbsp;</div><div>Intriguingly we noticed that even for excitatory responses, the amplitude of the transient seemed to be dependent on the baseline level at the time of stimulation (figure SXX).</div><ul><li></li></ul><div></div>
