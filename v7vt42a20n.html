<div>The range of observed responses is exposed in figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>A. Upon stimulation, effects ranged from a total absence of change (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Avi) to very large reliable transients (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Ai). In between those extremes, transients of variable size and reliability could be observed. Interestingly, we could also observe inhibitory responses. This was rendered possible by the fact that -- at least in some cell types -- the baseline fluorescence was fluctuating during the experiment (see Discussion and figure&nbsp;<b>SXX</b>) : even if hyperpolarizations below the resting potential are likely not detectable through GCaMP imaging, inhibition from an excited state do appear as dips in the fluorescence trace (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>Aii).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>We summarized the responses obtained with a battery of statistics (figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{489066}</span>B</div><div></div>
