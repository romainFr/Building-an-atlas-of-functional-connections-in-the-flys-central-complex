<div>Imaging was done on a 2-photon scanning microscope (PrairieTechnologies, Bruker). Brains were then continuously perfused in the saline used for dissection at 60mL/hour. Once the sample was placed and centered under the objective, we waited 5 minutes before starting the experiment to avoid any lingering network activation from the dissection or transmission lights. 2-photon excitation wavelength from a Coherent Ultra II (<b>check that</b>) was 920nm, and powers at the sample varied between 3 and 10mW. CsChrimson was excited with trains of 2 ms 590 nm light pulses via a LED (<b>thorlab ref</b>) shining through the objective. The excitation light path contained (<b>filter ref</b>) and (<b>dichroic ref</b>). Instantaneous power measured out of the objective was roughly 50Î¼W/mm 2 . Trains were delivered at 30Hz and the number of pulses was varied between 1,5,10, 20 and 30 -- corresponding to 2ms to 1s long stimulations. Imaging fields of view were chosen as to avoid scanning regions containing the CsChrimson while being as close as possible to the supposed connection site, &nbsp;as we observed occasional 2-photon stimulated slow activations of CsChrimson expressing cells pattern (as used in <b>cite Sung-Soo</b> and also observed <b>cite Allan if he reported it already</b>). When this was impossible -- for example in self-activation controls or for completely overlapping cell types -- we chose a large ROI of which the CsChrimson/GCaMP6-m represented a small fraction to minimize the duty cycle (<b>make a figure to show the overall ROI choice logic ?</b>). ROIs were maintained constant throughout the experiment. Each experimental run consisted of 4 repeats each approximately 16 seconds long. Runs were themselves repeated every 2 minutes. All experiments started with 5 runs corresponding to the 5 stimulation strengths, in a random order. This was sometimes followed by pharmacological testing. At the end of the experiment, a high intensity stack was acquired to insure the expression patterns were as expected, and the region imaged correct. At least 6 flies were tested for every pair considered.</div><div></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Pharmacology</h2><div></div>
