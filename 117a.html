<div>For blocking nicotinergic or inhibitory (GABAergic or glutamatergic) transmission, mecamylamine (50μM) or picrotoxin (10μM) (<b>refs for drugs</b>) were administered through the perfusion by switching to a different line for 3 minutes, followed by a wash period during which the perfusion was drug-free again. 30 pulses stimulations runs were repeated every 2 minutes starting 4 minutes the drug application and throughout the wash.</div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div>Analysis</div><div>All analysis was performed in&nbsp;<a href="http://julialang.org/" target="_blank">Julia</a>, using custom written routines (<b>we might want to think of making the github of that code public once it's cleaned, then link it on the website/ check if jupyter/figures embedding data would work for elife submissions</b>).</div><div>For a given experiment, all movies were aligned to each other to compensate for slow drifts of the sample : for each run, the average image was calculated, and average images were aligned using correlation based sub-pixel registration (<b>citation to Guizar, link to Julia repo</b>). A region of interest (ROI) was defined for the full experiment : the average image (of all the runs) was clustered between foreground and background by k-means. It’s worth noting that the selection method relies only on average intensity and not activity. This is because we want to use the same detection method for responsive and non-responsive runs. This also relies on selecting fields of view as unambiguously containing the neuron of interest – and only the neuron of interest – during the experiment.</div><div>ΔF/F0 (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\frac{\left(F-F_{0\ }\right)}{\left(F_0-B\right)}\)</span>, where F is the raw fluorescence and B the background signal -- <b>check how I calculate it in the script</b>) were then computed for each movie in the ROI. As we noticed that baseline fluorescence could vary widely over the course of an experiment (<b>ref to the part of the results or discussion where we'll cover that</b>), F0 is here defined as the average fluorescence in the ROI in the 10% (<b>check that</b>) dimmest frames of the full experiment.</div>
